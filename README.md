# NUITEQ Stage integration

[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nextcloud/integration_nuiteq/main/img/nuiteq.stage.logo.svg" width="200" />](https://nuiteqstage.se/en)

[NUITEQ Stage](https://nuiteqstage.se/en) creates a natural interaction between participants in a Modern Meeting by merging the experience of creating together on a whiteboard and discussing in a video call and chat.
Prepare and upload files and presentations, share them with others in the meeting. Designed for collaboration first to engage team members - NUITEQ Stage is safe, easy and efficient to use.

This app provides a simple interface in Nextcloud where you can connect to your NUITEQ account,
manage your boards and share board links to Nextcloud Talk conversations.

## üõ†Ô∏è State of maintenance

While there are some things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**.
This means:

* The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
* We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
* We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
* We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes.
We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

If you are a customer of Nextcloud and you have a strong business case for any development of this app, we will consider your wishes for our roadmap.
Please contact your account manager to talk about the possibilities.
