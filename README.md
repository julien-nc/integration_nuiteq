[NUITEQ Stage](https://nuiteqstage.se/en) creates a natural interaction between participants in a Modern Meeting by merging the experience of creating together on a whiteboard and discussing in a video call and chat. Prepare and upload files and presentations, share them with others in the meeting. Designed for collaboration first to engage team members - NUITEQ Stage is safe, easy and efficient to use.

This app provides a simple interface in Nextcloud where you can connect to your NUITEQ account,
manage your boards and share board links to Nextcloud Talk conversations.
